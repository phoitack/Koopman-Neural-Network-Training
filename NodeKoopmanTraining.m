%% Node Koopman Training
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------%
%   This function performs node Koopman training on D, which can be
%   composed of neural network weights and/or biases. This function was
%   used in Dogra and Redman, Advances in Neural Information Processing 
%   Systems 33 (NeurIPS 2020).
%
%   The assumptions here are that be that the input D is a tensor with the
%   weights/biases stored in the first and second dimensions, and the time
%   evolution stored in the third. Additionally, it assumes that the 
%   dimension being "noded" over is the second one (as is convention). 
%
%   The input q determines whether the weights/biases going to each node
%   should be further split up into finer chunks. Setting q = 1 sets them 
%   all into their own chunks and setting q = size(D, 2) sets them all into 
%   a single chunk.
